### Hey everyone, I'm Ana-Vlasic, I am currently working on my cs50 final project. My final project has two videos. The first video explain my code, the second video is about my chicken and the following text also explains my code.

Welcome to my website. This website is using HTML. This website is for people who have chickens. And if you watch this video, it has some tips on caring for chickens. You may also get some advice from a vet as it says in the video.

Here I can only explain a small part of my code:

On line 1 this is a doctype HTML.

On line 3 it is just html.
On line 4 is body. 
On line 5 is the style boarder that is solid violet. Around the border is my heading. 
On line 6 is a sentence regarding my images.
On line 7 to 10 is regarding my images and it's size.
On line 11 is regarding to the video controls and it's size
On line 12 is my Ana cs50.mp4 video.
On line 13 is video.
On line 14 is regarding to the video controls and it's size.
On line 15 is my chicken video.
On line 16 is video.
On line 17 is body.

After line 19 I have put in a colored boarder around the email address, password, file input, message, check me out and the submit button.

I hope you like my cs50 final project and a big thank you to Harvard University, David Malan and all cs50 staff you do a fantastic job.
