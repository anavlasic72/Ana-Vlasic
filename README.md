### Hey everyone, I'm Ana-Vlasic, I am currently working on my cs50 final project. My final project has two videos. The first video explain my code, the second video is about my chicken and the following text also explains my code.

Welcome to my website. This website is using HTML. This website is for people who have chickens. And if you watch this video, it has some tips on caring for chickens. You may also get some advice from a vet as it says in the video.

Here I can only explain a small part of my code:

On line 1  <!Doctype html>

On line 3  <html>
On line 4     <body>
On line 5         <h1 style="border: 4px solid Violet;">Ana's cs50 Final Project</h1>
On line 6         <br>On this page it is about chickens.<br>
On line 7         <img src="Ana.jpg" height="450" width="360"></img>
On line 8         <img src="IMG_20180502_190218.jpg" height="280" width="340"></img>
On line 9        <img src="IMG_20180610_094019.jpg" height="400" width="310"></img>
On line 10        <img src="IMG_20200624_153535.jpg" height="380" width="320"></img><br>
On line 11         <video controls width="800" height="400"></video>
On line 12          <source src="Ana CS50.mp4">
On line 13        </video>
On line 14        <video controls width="800" height="400">
On line 15            <source src="My chicken.mp4">
On line 16        </video>
On line 17    </body>

After line 19 I have put in a colored boarder around the email address, password, file input, message, check me out and the submit button.

I hope you like my cs50 final project and a big thank you to Harvard University, David Malan and all cs50 staff you do a fantastic job.
